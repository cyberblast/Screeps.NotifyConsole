This is a C# adaption of the great [screepers/screeps_notify](https://github.com/screepers/screeps_notify) project. 

It's not as complete as the original (e.g. sms still missing) and it's not using a docker container. Instead, it's a simple console application. 

The application is based on the C# [cyberblast/ScreepsClient](https://github.com/cyberblast/ScreepsClient) (not included in this repo). 
You need to create your individual app.config. There is a sample.app.config contained.
